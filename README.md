# My-Portfolio

# Purpose
This portfolio of work samples are to show employers what kind of works I can do, so that they can assess whether I fit with the open position.

## Description
* In "Work" section, you can find my works I've done until now. They will lead to the links of my works. Currently, only "Run Buddy" will take you to the link. Still working on the others.
